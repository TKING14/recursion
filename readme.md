### recursion

[introduction]
Hi, just explored recursion, learned about its existance a while ago, but never actually wrote a recursive function myself.

[core]
While I was creating a discord-application I had to traverse my filespace to register all slashcommands. However due to my previous approach to make things work as quickly as possibe I ran into a new challenge As I want to be flexible in how I add my directories and files I decided to research into it a little bit, at first I considered a simple function to go.


I  was working on a discord application and I was trying to register slashcommands,

the way you registerslash commands is as follows
over at discord it's a convention to create a individual files for each slashcommand you want to register. However as you can imagine things can quite easily become unmanagable, so I used the default file traferser they provided, but this only gave me the flexibility to add a singular layer to my commands folder.. Upon creating my second layer I ran into a problem, I couldn't reach the files anymore.. So, I had to change the way I traversed files.

Traversing files became a problem so I decided to figure out a way to make it work and provide more flexibility.

note:
I'm self-thought and that can seem chaotic at times,  

so I had to figure out a way to solve this problem. I mean, my technical-knowledge is quite limited, but my conceptual understanding is a little better, so I intuitively understood that I had to find a way to learn how to work with these kinds of problems, so I started searching traverse trees depth. 

I'm quit happy that I did cus now I have more tools under my belt, to tackle problems, and I'm satisfied with the results both intellectually and practically.

[conclusion]
quite proud how efficient I solved this problem that actually will benefit my project directly.

may or, probably, may not make this into a coherent report. at last this is the first draft, imma go jump into new adventuressss, bye bye *smiley_face*
